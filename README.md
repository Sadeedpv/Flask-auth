<h1 align='center'> Flask-auth ðŸ“²</h1>

Hello, this repo contains Flask-authentication sample in Python ðŸš€

That means;
A user can:
- Sign-in
- Log-in
- Reset your password
- Gmail confirmation after signin in

This app is smart enough to:

- Detect whether the use has logged in or not
- Whether the user tying to log-in have the exact credential on the database
- Sent mail for resetting the password
- Have strict form validations
- Hash the password before storing it into the database.
